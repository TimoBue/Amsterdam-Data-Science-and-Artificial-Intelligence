As part of my B.Sc. in Communication Science at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, I had fulfilled a minor in "Amsterdam Data Science and Artificial Intelligence". Resulting from this minor, this repository provides two relevant group projects, showcasing my own competencies in the relevant fields. The group projects were done for the courses "Data Wrangling" and "Text Retrieval and Mining". Both projects were given the highest achievable grade.
